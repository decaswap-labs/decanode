# Constants and Mimir

## Overview

The network launched with a set number of constants, which have not changed. Constants can be overridden via Mimir and nodes have the ability to [vote on](https://docs.thorchain.org/thornodes/overview#node-voting) and change Mimir values. \
See [Halt Management](./concepts/network-halts.md) for halt and pause specific settings.

Mimir setting can be created and changed without a corresponding Constant.

Mimirs have a maximum length of 128 bytes (see MaxMimirLength in THORNode code).

### Values

- Constant Values:[https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_midgard/v2/thorchain/constants](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/constants)
