# Transaction Memos

## Overview

Transactions to THORChain pass user intent with the `MEMO` field on their respective chains. THORChain inspects the transaction object and the `MEMO` in order to process the transaction, so care must be taken to ensure the `MEMO` and the transaction are both valid. If not, THORChain will automatically refund the assets. Memos are set in inbound transactions unless specified.

THORChain uses specific [asset notation](asset-notation.md) for all assets. Assets and functions can be abbreviated, and affiliate addresses and asset amounts can be shortened to [reduce memo length](memo-length-reduction.md), including through use of [scientific notation](memo-length-reduction.md#scientific-notation). Some parameters can also refer to a [THORName](../affiliate-guide/thorname-guide.md) instead of an address.

A guide has been created for [Swap](../swap-guide/quickstart-guide.md) to enable quoting and the automatic construction of memos for simplicity.

All memos are listed in the [relevant THORChain source code](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/x/thorchain/memo/memo.go) variable `stringToTxTypeMap`.

### Memo Size Limits

THORChain has a [memo size limit of 250 bytes](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/constants/constants.go?ref_type=heads#L32). Any inbound tx sent with a larger memo will be ignored. Additionally, memos on UTXO chains are further constrained by the `OP_RETURN` size limit, which is [80 bytes](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html#null-data), which can be extended by using the approach described [here](sending-transactions.md#memo-greater-than-80-characters).

### Dust Thresholds

THORChain has various dust thresholds (dust limits), defined on a per-chain basis. These are minimum amounts required for transactions to be processed by THORChain. Transactions below these thresholds will be ignored to prevent spam and ensure economic viability.

For example, sending 1 satoshi of BTC or 1 wei of ETH would be below the dust threshold and ignored. Each chain has different thresholds based on their native transaction costs and economic considerations. Refer to the [Dust Thresholds](../bifrost/vault-behaviors.md#dust-thresholds) for current threshold values for each supported chain.

## Format

All memos follow the format: `FUNCTION:PARAM1:PARAM2:PARAM3:PARAM4`

The function is invoked by a string, which in turn calls a particular handler in the state machine. The state machine parses the memo looking for the parameters which it simply decodes from human-readable strings.

Some parameters are optional. Simply leave them blank but retain the `:` separator, e.g., `FUNCTION:PARAM1:::PARAM4`.

### Swap

Perform an asset swap. THORChain supports different swap types using specific prefixes:

- **Market Swaps**: Use `=` prefix for immediate execution
- **Limit Swaps**: Use `=<` prefix for conditional execution based on price limits

**`SWAP:ASSET:DESTADDR:LIM/INTERVAL/QUANTITY:AFFILIATE:FEE`**

#### Advanced Swap Queue

THORChain uses an advanced swap queue system with different operational modes controlled by the `EnableAdvSwapQueue` mimir setting:

- **Disabled (0)**: Uses legacy swap queue
- **Enabled (1)**: Full advanced queue with both market and limit swaps
- **Market-only (2)**: Advanced queue for market swaps only, limit swaps are skipped

#### Swap Boundaries and Limits

**Limit Swap Expiration:**

- **Default TTL**: 43,200 blocks (~3 days)
- **Custom TTL**: Specify via `/INTERVAL` parameter (must be ≤ 43,200 blocks)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired limit swaps are automatically removed and remaining funds refunded

**Rapid Swap Processing:**

- The advanced queue can process multiple swap iterations per block
- Controlled by `AdvSwapQueueRapidSwapMax` mimir setting (default: 1)
- Enables higher throughput during peak activity

**Price Discovery:**

- Market swaps execute immediately at current pool prices
- Limit swaps only execute when the fee-less swap ratio meets the specified limit
- Advanced indexing system for efficient limit order matching

### REFERENCE MEMO - Memoless Transactions

Memoless transactions allow users to register a memo on THORChain and then reference it in future transactions using a short reference number encoded in the transaction amount. This enables transactions on chains with limited memo space (like Bitcoin's 80-byte OP_RETURN limit) by eliminating the need to include lengthy memos.

For detailed information, see [Memoless Transactions](../swap-guide/memoless-swaps.md).

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Payload      | The asset for the memoless transaction.            | Must match the asset registered in the memo. [Dust thresholds](#dust-thresholds) must be met. |
| `R`          | The reference memo usage handler.                  | Also `r`                                                                                      |
| `:REFERENCE` | The reference number assigned during registration. | Must be a valid, non-expired reference number.                                                |

**Important**: Before broadcasting, **always** call `GET /thorchain/memo/check/{asset}/{amount}` to validate:

- Reference exists and is not expired
- Usage limit not exceeded
- Memoless functionality not halted

**Transaction Flow:**

1. User sends RUNE with `REFERENCE:BTC.BTC:=:ETH.ETH:0xADDRESS` memo
2. THORChain assigns a reference number (e.g., 20002)
3. User can now use this reference for future BTC transactions. Reference expires post [`MemolessTxnTTL`](../mimir.md#memoless-transactions), approx. 6 hours

See [Memoless Swaps](../swap-guide/memoless-swaps.md) for detailed information.

#### Encoding Examples

**Bitcoin Example (8 decimals):**

- Reference: 20002
- Want to send: 0.05 BTC = 5000000
- Amount: 5000000 + 20002 = 5020002 satoshis
- Verification: 5020002 % 100000 = 20002 ✓

**Lower Decimal Asset Example - USDC (6 decimals):**

- Reference: 20002
- Want to send: 1500 units = 1500000000
- Amount: 1,500,000,000 + 20002 = 1,500,020,002 native units
- Verification: 1,500,020,002 % 100000 = 20002 ✓

**Configuration:**

- **TTL (Time To Live)**: `MemolessTxnTTL` - Reference memos expire after a configurable number of blocks (default: 3600 blocks ≈ 6 hours)
- **Reference Range**: `MemolessTxnRefCount` - Reference numbers range from 1 to this value (default: 99999). **CAUTION:** Changing this value changes the zero-padding normalization of reference keys. Existing non-expired references become inaccessible. Only change after all references have expired or with a coordinated migration.
- **Cost**: `MemolessTxnCost` - Additional protocol-level fee, currently set to 0
- **Max Usage**: `MemolessTxnMaxUse` - Maximum number of times a reference can be used (default: 1)
- **HaltMemoless**: Operational mimir to emergency halt all memoless functionality

**Examples:**

Registration:

- `REFERENCE:BTC.BTC:=:ETH.ETH:0x1c7b17362c84287bd1184447e6dfeaf920c31bbe`
  - Registers a swap from BTC to ETH memo for the specified address
  - Returns reference number (e.g., 20002)
  - Cost is only deducted if registration succeeds

Usage (Explicit):

- `R:20002` - Uses the registered memo with reference number 20002
- The actual swap will be executed using the originally registered memo

Usage (Amount-Encoded):

- Send `0.00020002 BTC` with empty memo
- THORChain extracts reference `20002` and resolves the registered swap memo
- Swap executes to ETH address `0x1c7b17362c84287bd1184447e6dfeaf920c31bbe`

**API Endpoints:**

- `GET /thorchain/memo/{asset}/{reference}` - Retrieve memo by asset and reference number
- `GET /thorchain/memo/{registration_hash}` - Retrieve memo by registration transaction hash
- `GET /thorchain/memo/check/{asset}/{amount}` - Pre-flight check: preview reference from amount and check availability

#### Reference Memo Lifecycle

Reference memos progress through distinct states from creation to expiration:

| **State**     | **Condition**                                    | **API Response**           | **User Action**  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **CREATED**   | `Height > 0`                                     | Returns reference details  | Can start using  |
| **ACTIVE**    | `Height + TTL > current`<br>AND<br>`usage < max` | Returns valid memo         | Normal usage     |
| **USED**      | `UsedByTxs` contains TxIDs                       | Returns memo + usage count | Monitor limits   |
| **EXHAUSTED** | `usage >= MemolessTxnMaxUse`                     | Returns empty → refund     | Must re-register |
| **EXPIRED**   | `Height + TTL < current`                         | Returns 404/empty → refund | Must re-register |
| **HALTED**    | `HaltMemoless` mimir > 0                         | Returns empty → refund     | Wait for unhalt  |

#### Emergency Halt System

**HaltMemoless Mimir**:

- **Purpose**: Emergency brake for security issues or bugs
- **Effect**: ALL memoless transactions rejected instantly
- **Monitoring**: Check [mimir endpoint](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/mimir)
- **Procedures**: See [Emergency Procedures](https://docs.thorchain.org/thornodes/emergency-procedures) for network halt operations

**Pre-Flight Checking:**

Before sending a memoless transaction, wallets should use the pre-flight API to verify:

- What reference will be extracted from the transaction amount
- Whether the reference is available or already registered
- When an existing registration expires
- Usage count vs. max usage limit
- Whether a new registration would succeed

## Refunds

The following are the conditions for refunds:

| Condition                | Conditions                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Invalid `MEMO`           | If the `MEMO` is incorrect the user will be refunded.                                                        |
| Invalid Assets           | If the asset for the transaction is incorrect (adding an asset into a wrong pool) the user will be refunded. |
| Invalid Transaction Type | If the user is performing a multi-send vs a send for a particular transaction, they are refunded.            |
| Exceeding Price Limit    | If the final value achieved in a trade differs to expected, they are refunded.                               |

Refunds cost fees to prevent DoS (denial-of-service) attacks. The user will pay the correct outbound fee for that chain. Refund memo is sent within a outbound transaction.
