# Versioning

THORNode follows a custom variation of semantic version structure: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `3.7.0`).

- The MAJOR version currently is updated per genesis export soft-fork.
- The MINOR version is updated for each consensus breaking release.
- The PATCH version is updated for each release and generally does not break consensus - Bifrost-only patches, API fixes, etc. In some specific cases (on `stagenet` for release candidates) the PATCH version may be used to indicate a consensus breaking change.

## Release Preparation

1. Create a milestone using the release version (e.g. [Release-3.7.0](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/milestones/161)).
2. Tag issues and PRs using the milestone, so we can identify which PR is on which version.
3. PRs require 3 approvals from the dev team - once approved, merge to `develop` branch.

## Stagenet Release

1. Create a new RC release at https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/releases for the version (e.g. `v3.7.0-rc1`) with the last commit for the release in `develop` as the tag target. Run `./scripts/prlog.py Release-3.7.0` to generate the output for the change log.
2. Checkout the release commit locally, then create the `stagenet` branch from it, and push it to the remote (force push may be necessary):

   ```bash
   git checkout v3.7.0-rc1
   git branch -D stagenet
   git checkout -b stagenet
   git push -f origin stagenet
   ```

3. The `build-thornode` job in the pipeline for the `stagenet` branch will build the release image. The upstream `node-launcher` values for `stagenet` images do not need to be kept up-to-date - they are for reference and state can be kept locally since there may be multiple private `stagenet` deployments.
4. Ensure authors of any large changes or features have provided a test plan.
5. Send the upgrade proposal from one of the active validators (`make shell` in `node-launcher`):

   ```bash
   thornode tx thorchain propose-upgrade [version] [height] --node http://localhost:27147 --chain-id thorchain-stagenet-2 --keyring-backend file --from thorchain
   ```

6. Approve the upgrade from all other nodes via the `make upgrade-vote` target in `node-launcher`.
7. Post in Discord `#stagenet` channel once the upgrade has succeeded tagging `@here` and requesting code authors to test their changes.
8. Testing will vary depending on the contents of the release, but general process should include:
   - Assist authors of large features and changes in completion of their test plan.
   - Ensure `stagenet` successfully completes a churn.
   - Operators of `stagenet` should test any node or operator specific functionality changes.
   - UIs should be sanity checked against any new API changes.
9. If there are bugs requiring a re-cut of the release, create a new release candidate (e.g. `v3.7.0-rc2`) and repeat the process from step 1, but add an additional commit directly on the `stagenet` branch before pushing that includes a patch release version bump ([example](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/commit/aea4146d05f9a94fbaf3105205f536a6b5b77a14)). Since the embedded version cannot support the RC suffix, subsequent RCs on `stagenet` will correspond to a patch version bump on `stagenet` only (e.g. `3.7.1` for `v3.7.0-rc2`).
10. Once `stagenet` has baked for the agreed period with no further issues, proceed with the `mainnet` release process.

## Mainnet Release

1. Determine the upgrade height and time - this must be at least 1 week out to accommodate agreements with exchanges and other stakeholders.
2. Checkout the release commit locally, then create the `mainnet` branch from it, and push it to the remote (force push may be necessary):

   ```bash
   git checkout v3.7.0-rc1
   git branch -D mainnet
   git checkout -b mainnet
   git push -f origin mainnet
   ```

3. Copy the contents of the final RC release (e.g. `v3.7.0-rc1`) to a new release (e.g. `v3.7.0`) at https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/releases, create the version tag on the `mainnet` branch you just pushed, and include the upgrade height and time in the release description in the following format:

   ```text
   - **Proposed Block**: `21210000`
   - **Date**: 22-May-2025 @ ~1:00pm EDT - https://runescan.io/block/21210000
   - **Note**: Block time is an estimate and may fluctuate.

   **Changelog**
   ...
   ```

4. The `build-thornode` job in the pipeline for the `mainnet` branch will build the release image.

5. Send the upgrade proposal from one of the active validators (`make shell` in `node-launcher`):

   ```bash
   thornode tx thorchain propose-upgrade [version] [height] --node http://localhost:27147 --chain-id thorchain-1 --keyring-backend file --from thorchain
   ```

6. Announce the upgrade proposal to be voted on in the Discord `#thornode-mainnet` channel with the format:

   ```text
   ### Mainnet 3.6.0 Upgrade Proposal - Validators Only

   **Changelog**: https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/releases/v3.6.0
   **Block**: `21210000`
   **Date**: 22-May-2025 @ ~1:00pm EDT - https://runescan.io/block/21210000
   **Note**: Block time is presently fluctuating - this time is an estimate and may fluctuate.

   <short description here>

   Please approve via `make upgrade-vote`:

   Select: `mainnet`
   Enter THORNode name: <thornode namespace>
   Enter THORNode upgrade proposal name: `3.6.0`
   Select THORNode upgrade proposal vote: `yes`

   @everyone
   ```

7. Relay the announcement to any relevant chats with exchanges to notify them of the upcoming fork.

8. PR in `node-launcher` to extend the [`thornode.versions`](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/devops/node-launcher/-/blob/master/thornode-stack/mainnet.yaml?ref_type=heads#L5) with the upgrade height and new version image.

9. Send an announcement in Discord `#thornode-mainnet` channel instructing nodes to apply so the upgrade is configured and the Cosmos Operator will make the switch at the upgrade height. The announcement can follow the format:

   ````text
   ## THORNODE ❗️ MAINNET ❗️ UPDATE 3.7.0
   https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/releases/v3.7.0

   NETWORK: MAINNET
   TYPE: Non-coordinated
   URGENCY: ASAP

   The upgrade proposal has passed. Please install to schedule the upgrade at the proposed height. Nodes will automatically update to the new image at the scheduled height, and the node version for active validators will be automatically set at that time. All non-active validators must run `make set-version` after the upgrade height to be eligible for the subsequent churn.

   ```
   make pull
   make install
   ```

   @everyone
   ````

10. Click the "Publish" button (horn emoji) on the announcement message to relay to other servers and the Telegram relay bot.

## Mainnet Release (Private Image)

In the case of a private mainnet release with security patches, the process remains the same with the following additions:

1. Push all public code included in the release to the `mainnet` branch as normal, but do not include the private security commits. After pushing the branch, stop the pipeline before it builds the image.
2. Add the following line to the release description before the changelog:

   ```text
   > **This release will use a private binary including additional security patches - DO NOT build from source.**
   ```

3. Manually build the release image including the cherry picked private security patches and push to the Gitlab container registry.
4. Add the following to the release announcement in Discord (modify as needed depending on circumstance):

   ```text
   > Please note that this release is a private image containing a security patch. Any nodes that wish to review the patch can make relay an `age` public key and one of the devs or THORSec will reply with an encrypted patch and instructions to verify the reproducible build hash.
   ```

## Bifrost-Only Patch Release

Bifrost-only patches do not break consensus and can generally be released without an upgrade proposal or coordinated upgrade height. These are used for fixes isolated to the Bifrost component (observer/signer changes, chain client fixes, etc).

1. Merge the patch PR(s) to `develop`.

2. Ensure your local `mainnet` branch is up to date with `origin`:

   ```bash
   git checkout origin/mainnet
   git branch -D mainnet
   git checkout -b mainnet
   ```

3. Cherry pick the patch commit(s) from `develop` to `mainnet`:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit hash>
   ```

4. Create a commit (example: https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/commit/989f58a4402640f5d82a606d81a42676030a2f23) with the version upgrade titled in the form `Release 3.15.1` containing:

   - Bump the `version` file.
   - Committed changes after `make generate`.
   - Update `app/upgrades.go` following the detailed instructions in the file comments to explicitly create a `standard.NewUpgrade` using the current network consensus version. Otherwise the patch version will be automatically set in the app upgrades and cause consensus failure when a node is updated.

5. Push the `mainnet` branch to the remote:

   ```bash
   git push origin mainnet
   ```

6. Create a new release at https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/releases for the patch version (e.g. `v3.15.1`) creating the tag based on the tip commit of the just pushed `mainnet` branch.

7. The `build-thornode` job in the pipeline for the `mainnet` branch will build and push the release image.

8. PR in `node-launcher` to update the last entry in [`thornode.versions`](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/devops/node-launcher/-/blob/master/thornode-stack/mainnet.yaml?ref_type=heads#L5) image to the new patch version. If there are any dependency changes it is safest to only update the Bifrost image and leave the THORNode consensus image unchanged, in case any dependency changes have potential to cause a consensus break. Otherwise both images can be updated and nodes can be instructed to `make set-version` after applying to ensure they report the upgrade to the latest version and do not get churned out for low version.

9. Send an announcement in Discord `#thornode-mainnet` channel instructing nodes to apply the patch release. The announcement can follow the format:

   ````text
   ## THORNODE ❗️ MAINNET ❗️ UPDATE 3.15.1 (Bifrost) ❗️ VALIDATORS ONLY
   https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/releases/v3.15.1

   NETWORK: MAINNET
   TYPE: Non-coordinated
   URGENCY: ASAP

   This is a Bifrost patch release containing a fix for <short description of issue>.

   ```
   make pull
   make install
   ```

   @everyone
   ````

10. Click the "Publish" button (horn emoji) on the announcement message to relay to other servers and the Telegram relay bot.
