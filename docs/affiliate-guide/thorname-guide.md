# THORName Guide

## Summary

[THORNames](https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/thorchain-name-service) are THORChain's vanity address system that allows affiliates to collect fees and track their user's transactions. THORNames exist on the THORChain L1, so you will need a THORChain address and $RUNE to create and manage a THORName.

THORNames have the following properties:

- **Name:** The THORName's string. Between 1-30 hexadecimal characters and `-_+` special characters.
- **Owner**: This is the THORChain address that owns the THORName
- **Aliases**: THORNames can have an alias address for any external chain supported by THORChain, and can have an alias for the THORChain L1 that is different than the owner.
- **Expiry:** THORChain Block-height at which the THORName expires.
- **Preferred Asset:** The asset to pay out affiliate fees in. This can be any asset supported by THORChain.

## Create a THORName

THORNames are created by posting a `MsgDeposit` to the THORChain network with the appropriate [memo](../concepts/memos.md) and enough $RUNE to cover the registration fee and to pay for the amount of blocks the THORName should be registered for.

- **Registration fee**: `tns_register_fee_rune` on the [Network endpoint](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/network). This value is in 1e8, so `100000000 = 1 $RUNE`
- **Per block fee**: `tns_fee_per_block_rune` on the same endpoint, also in 1e8.

For example, for a new THORName to be registered for 10 years the amount paid would be:

`amt = tns_register_fee_rune + tns_fee_per_block_rune * 10 * 5256000`

`5256000 = avg # of blocks per year`

The expiration of the THORName will automatically be set to the number of blocks in the future that was paid for minus the registration fee.

**Memo Format:**

Memo template is: `~:name:chain:address:?owner:?preferredAsset:?expiry:?preferredAssetOutboundFeeMultiplier`

- **name**: Your THORName. Must be unique, between 1-30 characters, hexadecimal and `-_+` special characters.
- **chain:** The chain of the alias to set.
- **address**: The alias address. Must be an address of chain.
- **owner**: THORChain address of owner (optional).
- **preferredAsset:** Asset to receive fees in. Must be supported by an active pool on THORChain. Value should be `asset` property from the [Pools endpoint](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/pools).
- **preferredAssetOutboundFeeMultiplier:** Optional parameter. Custom multiplier for the outbound fee threshold for affiliate fee payouts. This enables affiliate fees to get paid out at a custom threshold. If not specified, uses the global default of 100. Must be between 0 and 10000 (0 resets to global default). This determines how much RUNE must accumulate before triggering a payout in your preferred asset.
  - Example: Assuming default of 100, if your preferred asset is ETH.USDC and the ETH.USDC outbound fee is $1, the RUNE gets swapped to ETH.USDC and sent to your address when it hits $100 (100 \* $1).

```admonish info
Example: `~:ODIN:BTC:bc1Address:thorAddress:BTC.BTC`
Example with custom multiplier: `~:ODIN:BTC:bc1Address:thorAddress:BTC.BTC::500`
```

This will register a new THORName called `ODIN` with a Bitcoin alias of `bc1Address` owner of `thorAddress` and preferred asset of BTC.BTC.

```admonish info
You can use [Asgardex](https://github.com/asgardex/asgardex-desktop) to post a MsgDeposit with a custom memo. Load your wallet, then open your THORChain wallet page > Deposit > Custom.
```

```admonish info
View your THORName's configuration at the THORName endpoint:

e.g. [https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/thorname/](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/thorname/ac-test){name}
```

## Renewing your THORName

All THORName's have a expiration represented by a THORChain block-height. Once the expiration block-height has passed, another THORChain address can claim the THORName and any associated balance in the Affiliate Fee Collector Module (Read [#preferred-asset-for-affiliate-fees](thorname-guide.md#preferred-asset-for-affiliate-fees "mention")), so it's important to monitor this and renew your THORName as needed.

To keep your THORName registered you can extend the registration period (move back the expiration block height), by posting a `MsgDeposit` with the correct THORName memo and $RUNE amount.

**Memo:**

`~:ODIN:THOR:<thor-alias-address>`

_(Chain and alias address are required, so just use current values to keep alias unchanged)._

**$RUNE Amount:**

`rune_amt = num_blocks_to_extend * tns_fee_per_block`

_(Remember this value will be in 1e8, so adjust accordingly for your transaction)._

## Preferred Asset for Affiliate Fees

Affiliates can collect their fees in the asset of their choice (choosing from the assets that have a pool on THORChain). In order to collect fees in a preferred asset, affiliates must use a [THORName](https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/thorchain-name-service) in their swap memos.

### Configuring a Preferred Asset for a THORName

1. [**Register a THORName**](../affiliate-guide/thorname-guide.md#create-a-thorname) if not done already. This is done with a `MsgDeposit` posted to the THORChain network.
2. Set your preferred asset's chain alias (the address you'll be paid out to), and your preferred asset. _Note: your preferred asset must be currently supported by THORChain._

For example, if you wanted to be paid out in USDC you would:

1. Grab the full USDC name from the [Pools](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/pools) endpoint: `ETH.USDC-0XA0B86991C6218B36C1D19D4A2E9EB0CE3606EB48`
2. Post a `MsgDeposit` to the THORChain network with the appropriate memo to register your THORName, set your preferred asset as USDC, and set your Ethereum network address alias. Assuming the following info:

   1. THORChain address: `thor1dl7un46w7l7f3ewrnrm6nq58nerjtp0dradjtd`
   2. THORName: `ac-test`
   3. ETH payout address: `0x6621d872f17109d6601c49edba526ebcfd332d5d`

   The full memo would look like:

   > `~:ac-test:ETH:0x6621d872f17109d6601c49edba526ebcfd332d5d:thor1dl7un46w7l7f3ewrnrm6nq58nerjtp0dradjtd:ETH.USDC-0XA0B86991C6218B36C1D19D4A2E9EB0CE3606EB48`

   To set a custom payout threshold (e.g., 50x the outbound fee instead of the default), add the multiplier:

   > `~:ac-test:ETH:0x6621d872f17109d6601c49edba526ebcfd332d5d:thor1dl7un46w7l7f3ewrnrm6nq58nerjtp0dradjtd:ETH.USDC-0XA0B86991C6218B36C1D19D4A2E9EB0CE3606EB48::50`

```admonish info
You can use [Asgardex](https://github.com/asgardex/asgardex-desktop) to post a MsgDeposit with a custom memo. Load your wallet, then open your THORChain wallet page > Deposit > Custom.
```

```admonish info
You will also need a THOR alias set to collect affiliate fees. Use another MsgDeposit with memo: `~:<thorname>:THOR:<thorchain-address>` to set your THOR alias. Your THOR alias address can be the same as your owner address, but won't be used for anything if a preferred asset is set.
```

Once you successfully post your MsgDeposit you can verify that your THORName is configured properly. View your THORName info from THORNode at the following endpoint:\
[https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/thorname/ac-test](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/thorname/ac-test)

The response should look like:

```json
{
  "name": "ac-test",
  "expire_block_height": 28061405,
  "owner": "thor19phfqh3ce3nnjhh0cssn433nydq9shx7wfmk7k",
  "preferred_asset": "BNB.BUSD-BD1",
  "affiliate_collector_rune": "0",
  "aliases": [
    {
      "chain": "ETH",
      "address": "0x3021c479f7f8c9f1d5c7d8523ba5e22c0bcb5430"
    },
    {
      "chain": "THOR",
      "address": "thor19phfqh3ce3nnjhh0cssn433nydq9shx7wfmk7k"
    },
    {
      "chain": "BNB",
      "address": "bnb1laxspje9u0faauqh7j07p9x6ds8lg4ychhg5qh"
    }
  ],
  "preferred_asset_swap_threshold_rune": "0"
}
```

Your THORName is now properly configured and any affiliate fees will begin accruing in the AffiliateCollector module. You can verify that fees are being collected by checking the `affiliate_collector_rune` value of the above endpoint.
