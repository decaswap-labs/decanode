# Affiliate Fee Guide

Affiliate fees provide a way for interfaces to generate revenue through THORChain. These fees are collected from select transactions, sent to an affiliate collector module, and periodically distributed in a gas-efficient manner using the interface's preferred asset. These fees range from 0 to 10,000 basis points (bps), where 100 bps equals 1%, and are deducted from either the inbound or outbound transaction amount.

## Overview

- **Fee Structure**: Affiliate fees are calculated in basis points and deducted from the transaction amount.
- **THORName Requirement**: A valid THORName is required to collect affiliate fees. Learn how to create a THORName [here](./thorname-guide.md).
- **Preferred Asset**: By default, affiliates are paid in $RUNE, but a preferred asset can be specified using a THORName.
- **Multiple Affiliates for Swaps**: Swaps can support multiple affiliate fees, while single affiliate fees apply to savings deposits and RUNE pool withdrawals.
- **Automatic Distribution**: Affiliate fees are automatically distributed to the affiliate address within your THORName based on accumulated thresholds. No manual processing is required.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a THORName:** See the [THORName Guide](./thorname-guide.md) for instructions.
1. **Set Up Your Preferred Asset:** Configure your [preferred asset](./thorname-guide.md#preferred-asset-for-affiliate-fees), such as USDC or BTC. By default, the affiliate asset is $RUNE.
1. **Enable Multiple Affiliates:** Set up [multiple affiliate](#multiple-affiliates) addresses for swap transactions.
1. **Set the Affiliate Fee Amount:** Specify the affiliate fee in basis points (0–10,000) in your transactions. See [Transaction Memos](../concepts/memos.md) for details.
1. **Start Using THORChain:** Let the affiliate collector module handle the periodic distribution of fees.

## Where the Affiliate Fee is Taken

- If the inbound swap asset is a native THORChain asset ($RUNE, synth, or trade asset), the affiliate fee amount will be deducted directly from the transaction amount.
- If the inbound swap asset is on any other chain, the network will submit a swap to $RUNE.
- If the affiliate is added to an `ADDLP` transaction, then the affiliate is included in the network as an LP.
- If the affiliate is added to a RUNEPool withdrawal, it is deducted from the profit amount (positive PnL), not the principal.

## How it Works

The affiliate fee system operates automatically, following these steps:

1. **Transaction Execution**: When a transaction includes an affiliate fee, the specified amount (in basis points) is deducted from the inbound or outbound transaction amount as described above.
1. **Fee Collection**: The deducted fee is collected in the [AffiliateCollector module](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/balance/module/affiliate_collector), where it is held in $RUNE by default.
1. **Threshold Check**: The network continuously monitors the accumulated $RUNE for each affiliate. Once the balance exceeds [`PreferredAssetOutboundFeeMultiplier`](../mimir.md#fee-management) multiplied by the chain's outbound fee, the system initiates a swap to the preferred asset.
   - Example: If the outbound fee for BTC is 0.00005 BTC and the multiplier is 200, the swap will occur when the collected $RUNE is worth 0.01 BTC.
1. **Preferred Asset Swap**: If the affiliate's THORName specifies a preferred asset (e.g., BTC, USDC), the network swaps $RUNE to that asset before distribution. If no preferred asset is set, $RUNE is distributed directly.
1. **Automatic Distribution**: The converted (or original) amount is sent to the affiliate's address without requiring any manual intervention.

### Benefits of Automatic Distribution

- **Gas Efficiency**: By waiting until the threshold is met, the network minimizes gas costs associated with frequent small transactions.
- **Asset Flexibility**: Affiliates can specify any supported asset as their preferred payout, ensuring they receive fees in the most convenient form.

## Multiple Affiliates

Interfaces can define up to a limit set by [MultipleAffiliatesMaxCount](../mimir.md) for valid affiliate and affiliate basis points pairs in a swap memo. This is used if more than one affiliate needs to be paid, e.g. an interface and implementation partner.
The network deducts a fee for each valid affiliate defined in the memo. Alternatively, up to 5 valid affiliates and exactly one valid basis point value can be defined, and the network will attempt to skim the same basis point fee for each affiliate.

  _(Will skim 10 basis points for `t1`, 20 basis points for `thor1t2hav42urasnsvwa6x6fyezaex9f953plh72pq`, and 30 basis points for `t3`)_
