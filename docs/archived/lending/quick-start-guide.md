# Quick Start Guide

[Lending](https://docs.thorchain.org/thorchain-finance/lending) allows users to deposit native collateral, and then create a debt at a collateralization ratio `CR` (collateralization ratio). The debt is always denominated in USD (aka `TOR`) regardless of what L1 asset the user receives.

```admonish info
Lending will be moved to the App Layer; new loans within THORChain can no longer be opened.
```

## Open a Loan Quote

Lending Quote endpoints have been created to simplify the implementation process.

**Request:** Loan quote using 1 BTC as collateral, target debt asset is USDT at 0XDAC17F958D2EE523A2206206994597C13D831EC7

```admonish danger
The `Inbound_Address` changes regularly, do not cache!
```

```admonish warning
Loans cannot be repaid until a minimum time has passed, as determined by [LOANREPAYMENTMATURITY](https://gateway.liquify.com/chain/thorchain_api/thorchain/mimir), which is currently set as the current block height plus LOANREPAYMENTMATURITY. Currently, LOANREPAYMENTMATURITY is set to 432,000 blocks, equivalent to 30 days. Increasing the collateral on an existing loan to obtain additional debt resets the period.
